When the lockdown was announced, I had a couple of thoughts on my mind that I had to think through that are quiet personal but I barely used two days for it and that too not consecutive. Then I was doing my regular work tasks apart from which I realised I have significant amount of time.

I thought I should work on my pet project which I thought I would implement in Rust for which I had to learn the language in the first palce and was positive that this quarantine will allow me to do so. _I was naive_.

Why only Rust? I asked myself and thought I should learn everything that I'm interested in and read some books as well in parallel.

The next day, I started reading _The Rust Programming Language_ book. After a complete 8 hrs of investment in it, I was sucessfull in reading just 25% of the book. Remember, I was reading line-to-line and maybe even between the lines of the book. All that was apart from actually practicing the concepts. I felt like I understood good part of the language and thought I should implement my project. _I was naiver_.

The next day, I woke up, started the project just to find that a huge pause was on its way to hit me, hit me hard, coz I didn't know what to start with, coz I wrote nothing but a _Hello World!_ program until then. I literally had no clue on how to implement my own project.

Without wasting time, I resorted to resuming reading the book on Rust. I then completed till 32%. Learnt a couple of concepts more but was just as clueless as I was before reading that extra 7%.

Depressed, I started reading a fiction novel and since then I completed reading 3 fiction novels and completed reading upto 50% on average on 3 other books among which one was neither a fiction nor a novel or even a book on Rust.

As a result, I wondered what is keeping me from doing the stuff I myself have thought of. Asked sir _[Google](http://www.google.com)_ and landed on a list of productivity content that could probably be used as a scale to measure the distances between multiple galaxies.

I read some blogs, made some plans and failed sticking to them, watched some videos and scheduled my plans and failed once again and this process kept repeating for a couple of days. I was installing and removing new apps, writing plans and schedules on paper, trying the built in apps on my phone and what not. _I was naivest_.

Disappointed,
