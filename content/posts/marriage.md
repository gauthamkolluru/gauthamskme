**Disclaimer**: The following content is my theory on the titled subject of inception and evolution of marriage. Nothing written in here is intended to dishonor or disrespect any individual's or a group's views, thoughts or beliefs. I also have to mention that I haven't read / heard / viewed any existing material of any form about the subject as I myself was theorising the a possible course of the evolution of it. The main purpose of this material is to provide it's readers with a perspective or precisely my view / analysis of the subject.

**Foreword**: It is my sincere and humble request to the readers who starts reading the to please read and understand the article in it's totality and do not draw conclusions anytime before. As my friend used to say, "*Bhavnaon ko Samjho, Shabdon main kya rakha hay!*", which means to understand what the writer is trying to convey (and what's there is mere sounds...).

## The Inception

Millions of years ago, earlier to the early men, before the transformation of Hominoidea into Homo Sapiens, every living being should've been just a creature or an animal and the World was just a giant forest.The times where animals should've just lived and thrived. Each living organism had it's own eating, roaming / hunting / escaping and sleeping cycle. Most creature, apart from the previously mentioned, also had physical / chemical urge for mating for also had it's own cycle. All they used to do was to find a counterpart and just get over with it. I wonder not if the mating partners knew each other but had they even bothered of knowing each other?

Then, during the course of time, the **Hominoidea** started evolving into the **Homo Sapiens** or Human Beings whom are initially refered to as the Early-men or Cave-men which I see majorly as the transformation that should be called as maturity of the brain which perhaps paved the way of living as mentioned in the quote above, as to be aware of being aware. The Human Beings, have started maturing way faster than other beings by implementing their awareness in improving the living standards for themselves and as time passed by innovations too spread their wings across all aspects of living. Changes happened in the way they made shelter for themselves, the way they hunted, the way they ate and so on.

During this period of evolution, being the living that descended from the already [pair bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_bond) adopted species, they have ventured with ideas and innovation into this branch of living as well. Innovation has succeeded either by imagining the unimagined or by witnessing it, either way to solve a problem or improve an existing solution. Being the beings of more awareness, they were getting aware that the natural phenomenon of pair bond is not happening with every individual, leaving those individuals lead a singular life. The antecedents of such individuals have then thought of making this natural phenomenon leaving it no more natural.

Thus incepted the concept of marriage (I ain't sure if that was they called it then if at all they did though).

## The Evolution

As they say that, "The first bike race happend when the second bike was made!", the Sapiens as a sign of awareness, incepted the already evolved method of evaluating choices by comparing them, into this no more natural pair bonding. As soon as
