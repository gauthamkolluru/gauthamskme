# It’s time to watch ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’... Dobara!

<center><i>Hey hey suno na, dhoonde shehr naya...

Jahan muskuraahatein hain bikhre,

Jahan se gham ka mausam gaya...

I’m such kind of a person who loves to watch movies and I’m very choosy as well at what to watch. I pick my movies depending on the director or actor.

A good-while-ago, I chose to watch the film [‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562872/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) (ZNMD) only because of [Farhan akhtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhan_Akhtar) and [Naseerudding Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naseeruddin_Shah), two of the finest actors Indian cinema has produced by far. Since then, I do not remember how many times I watched that movie already!

We all have a list of movies that we would like to come back to and watch time and time again. ZNMD is one from my list.

There are times when I felt like I'm exhausted, tired, vexed up, lost amidst this daily routines ending up feeling low. There are moments when I didn't even want to have a glance at what I love the most. There were times when I just felt low, as if I'm drowned to the abyss of an ocean and not even sure of the reason. 

I just try to think less at such times and watch ZNMD. I watch it again and again to have a couple of laughs, to feel nostasgic of some moments, to cherish some memories and to be inspired by the writings of [Javed Akhtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javed_Akhtar) sahb. For they sound so soulful, meaningful, soothing and inspiring. Though all poems sound and feel great, this one poem has hit the chords hard.

<i>
Dilon Mein Tum Apni Betaabiyan Leke Chal Rahe Ho
Toh Zinda Ho Tum!

Nazar Mein Khwaabon Ki Bijliyan Leke Chal Rahe Ho
Toh Zinda Ho Tum!

Hawa Ke Jhokon Ke Jaise Azaad Rehno Seekho...

Tum Ek Dariya Ke Jaise Lehron Mein Behna Seekho...

Har Ek Lamhe Se Tum Milo Khole Apni Baahein...

Har Ek Pal Ek Naya Samaa Dekhe Yeh Nigaahein...

Jo Apni Aankhon Mein Hayraniya Leke Chal Rahe Ho
Toh Zinda Ho Tum!

Dilon Mein Tum Apni Betaabiyan Leke Chal Rahe Ho
Toh Zinda Ho Tum!
</i>

It is with this inspiring poem the film ends with that leaves me in an at least comparatively positive note with some rejuvenated confidence, hope and energy. 

Aakhir (after all), *Kab tak giney, hum dhadkane, dil jaise dhadke dhadakne do*...!
