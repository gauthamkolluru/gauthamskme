## Here's a way to go...

I have recently bought a MBP with RAM upgraded to 16gb for its:

- Sheer computational power
- Claimed brilliance at battery discharges
- macOS and
- Terminal (long time love)

and so, the other day, I have decided to unplug my beast and use. As per the claims, I should be able to go at least 3 business days before plugging it back to charge, right?

So, I pulled off the plug the day before at around 10pm and used it for just a bit. The next morning, at around 10 / 11am, I had to connect to my work PC for which I use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12) application.

I've been using it unplugged and by 4 or 5pm in the evening, when I just happened to take a glance at the little battery icon above, boom, the battery percentage was showing as 30% remaining.

Struck by shock and worried if there is any issue with my machine, I searched the internet for any reported problems of batery with M1 Macs, thanks to [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) and [Rakesh the author of this article](https://rakhesh.com/mac/try-microsoft-remote-desktop-if-you-want-to-drain-the-m1-battery-ðŸ˜€/) for it being the first article in the result, after reading which i felt a bit better learning it was the issue with the remote desktop app.

But now I'm concerned with if the battery drain is because of,

- Microsoft's application or
- Windows' computer on the other end (:wink) or
- the facility of using a desktop remotely?
