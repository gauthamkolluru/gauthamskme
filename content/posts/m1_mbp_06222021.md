## Here's a way to go...

I have recently bought an MBP with RAM upgraded to 16gb for:

- Sheer computational power
- Claimed to be brilliant at battery discharges
- macOS and
- Terminal <span class="highlight">(long time love)</span>

and so, the other day, I have decided to unplug my beast and use. As per the claims, I should be able to go at least 3 business days before plugging it charge. 

I pulled off the plug the day before at around 10pm and used it for just a bit and that too very minimally. The next morning, at around 10 / 11am, I had to connect to my work PC for which I use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12). 

By 4 or 5pm in the evening, boom, the battery percentage was showing as 30% remaining. 

Shocked and worried if there is an issue with my machine, I searched on the net and thanks to [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) and Rakesh the author of [this article](https://rakhesh.com/mac/try-microsoft-remote-desktop-if-you-want-to-drain-the-m1-battery-ðŸ˜€/) which was the first suggestion and then i felt a bit better.

But now, my concern is, if the battery drain is because of,

- Microsoft's application not being optimised or
- Windows' computer on the other end or (:wink)
- the facility of using a desktop remotely?
