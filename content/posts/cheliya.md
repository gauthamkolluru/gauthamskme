P:

    Cheliya.. Oh cheliya...
    Neevae lae naa yadalo laya...
    Cheliya.. Na cheliya...
    Neekai kariganae nae kanneerula...
    Neeke needaga nene nilichanae oh cheliya...
    Ninne na kalalalo chustu migilanae oh kadha la...

CH:

    Yeda laya lo- naa- swasalalona,
    Nee oosulae vintunna... Haye
    Yetuveluthunna yenchestunna,
    Madi ninne talachena...
    Premisthunna ani chupulathonae cheputhunna...
    Oo kshanamaina teliyanaelaeda oh maina...


    That I feel so lonely, yeah...
    therez a better place from this emptiness...
    and I'm so lonely yeah...
    therez a better place from this emptiness...!


P.S.: This was written as a response to [Kaushi Diwakar's Female version of Gajendra Varma's original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKER4jMSYyQ) and the English lines were taken from the original song itself!

This piece of mine is so special to me as this is the first one that I finished writing as both the Pallavi and Charanam.
