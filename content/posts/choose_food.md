## Foreword

This blog post ain't being used for publishing _my_ opinion and I ain't advocating for anybody, not even myself. I feel that I have a perspective that I want to share with _you_ and this post is just a mere medium. Both, this posts's and my intentions are just to convey my perspective and hope that at least a few of you would ponder on it, if they think it needs pondering.

## The Inception

_**I**t all started when I first had meat_. As a quick background info, I hail from a family that belogs to a community that is supposedly restricted to eat meat. I was introduced to that page of the menu quiet early and as I grew, I tried a variety of animals in my plate though not much different from what the world, statistically consumes by frequency or volumes in average. I had meat either at restaurants or at my friend's place but mostly with my friends and almost always, somebody in the gathering, out of no context, claims, "This guy hails from a community that shouldn't eat meat... ", to which, somebody else asks me, "Does your parents know?". At times when the discussion extended, I used to try to present a _perspective_ to which, the reply had always been, "You're just trying to justify!" or "You're just trying to defend your actions!" or "You all just need a reason!".

## The Thoughts

Since I first heard those questions and the comments, I had thought like, "but I was never trying to defend my actions" and many times I had a question in the back of my head that, "and how does that concern you?" when they ask me "Does your parents know?" but never asked because either we've met just then or was an elderly figure.

Later on, I came up with more questions as and when I came up with more inputs like, the same community of people like mine but from a different state (geographical) are allowed to eat _fish_. I wondered, "How come?" and "Who is setting up such rules?" and "Where are these mentioned?"

## The Idea

**O**ne day, while my mom was reading a book and she found it amusing, I guess, and read that out for me. A sentence from the book. It was from one of the books written by [Yendamuri Veerendranath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandamuri_Veerendranath). I couldn't paraphrase the exact sentence from the book but it delivered the message that, "Eating habits of individuals have been developed according to the availability of choices around them and that is pretty much determined by their geographical locations".

**A**nother day, while I was watching the [National Geographic Channel](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/), I came across a documentary where one of the tribes in Africa, living in the deserts, were actually having _rats_ for lunch and dinners.

## The Ponder

With the brain that needs something to grind at all times, there wasn't there any issue in finding time to ponder upon the thoughts or even to just switch the topic whenever, I felt that, that wasn't the time.

## The Perspective
