<h2>Hi</h2>
<p>Its around a millionth time I'm re-writing this and yet not sure if its how I want it to be.</p>
<p>My name is Gautham (and I'm <i>kind</i> of sure you've had figured that out by now) and I'm just a homo sapien
        interested in Numbers, Physics, Problem Solving / Optimising, Proramming, Computers, Technology, Coffee, Books
        and Blogging.

<!-- <p>I am Gautham and this is my space in this centralised system for sharing information called, <span
                        class="highlight">internet</span> and as the definition suggests, I rented this place to share the
                stuff I write.</p>
        <p>I write both Prose and Poetry. While my prose articles can be technical or non-technical, my poetry, by far,
                has been mostly emotional and/or cultural.</p>
        <p>The technical articles include but are not limited to <span class="highlight">Programming, Python and
                        any Side-Projects</span>, I take up.</p> -->
